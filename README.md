To study their dynamical characteristics, hairpins were first introduced into the laminar boundary layer inexperiments[7－9]. These manually excited hairpins have satisfying symmetry and integrity. Moreover, the laminar background ensures the feasibility of identifying these hairpins and tracking their downstream evolution with less difficulty by visualization techniques. On the other hand, the advances in the technique of vortex identification schemes enable us to identify vortical structures from turbulent velocity field in a quantitative way. The widely-used vortex identification schemes include Q-criteria[10], λ2-criteria[11], Δ-criteria[12] and λci-criteria[13]. All these schemes are based on Eulerian system, using certain characteristics of invariant of velocity gradient tensor ∇v to depict vortex. In order to compute eigenvalues of ∇v , three-dimensional instant velocity field with adequate spatial resolution is required, which is difficult for present experimental techniques. Therefore, these Eulerian-based schemes are now mainly used to identify vortical structures from direct numerical simulation (DNS) database of turbulence channel flow[6,13].

Another kind of schemes belongs to Lagrangian system.Instead of invariant of ∇v , time-integrated properties of fluid particle trajectories are used to identify vortical structures. One of the typical Lagrangian-based schemes is Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE) method. Green et al.[14] educed hairpin-like Lagrangian structures from DNS database of turbulence channel flow. However, no studies on identifying Lagrangian structures from experimentally-measured wall turbulence have been reported. Taking this as the primary goal of the present work, we measure 2D velocity field of a flat-plate turbulent boundary layer by time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV), and apply the FTLE method to educe Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) in the turbulent boundary layer. Moreover, the phenomenological characteristics of LCSs and their convection statistics are further analyzed.
